# IMPORTANT
The site is **down**. I'll not longer host the API, so if you want to use it, you'll have to host an instance by yourself. If I find enough time, I'll publish a little documentation on how to get the required auth tokens to communicate with the Nintendo servers. I can already tell that you need to capture traffic of your mobile device, and capture requests of the NSO (Nintendo Switch Online) app. Then you can find the required auth token.
